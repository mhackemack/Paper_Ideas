%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The DFEM $S_N$ Transport Equation} \label{sec::trans_DFEMSn}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Look at Bruno's MIP paper here
% 1) start with continuous equation with isotropic source and scattering
% 2) 
% 3) 


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Solving with a Richardson Iteration Scheme} \label{sec::trans_SI}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% 1) operator notation from previous section to define SI

\section{Preconditioning by Synthetic Acceleration} \label{sec::accel}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Discuss overview of synthetic acceleration
% 1) formulation to get to low-order operator
% 2) mention that we will use DSA
% 3) mention particular DSA is MIP (with section mention)

\section{Fourier Analysis} \label{sec::fourier}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 1) Present brief overview of Fourier analysis - look at Bruno's and M&C2017 upscatter for ideas on brevity
%     - FA analysis is common tool for DSA transport (Adam & Larsen, Larsen TTSP paper, Warse et all paper on FCDSA on tets)
%     - iteration matrix eigenvalues are analyzed
%     - Fourier ansatz with wave numbers
%     - give alterred matrices
% 2) Results
%     - Homogeneous cube results
%     - Homogeneous AR results
%     - Possibly include the NSR results
